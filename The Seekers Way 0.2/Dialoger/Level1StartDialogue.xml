		<speech text="In the mystical world of Zodiac, where magic is part of everyday-life, and dragons soar freely in the sky, many wanderers called “adventurers” walk the earth. These adventurers are searching for mysteries of old, searching for answers… and hidden treasures.
	To help them on their journeys, the Adventurers’ Guild was founded. In every major city, a guild inn was built. There, adventurers from all over the world could find shelter, and accept contracts as temporary workers.
	At the end of each year, the Adventurers’ Guild holds a gathering in the human capital of Caelum to present the number one adventurer of the year, the adventurer who is then entitled as the Seeker.
